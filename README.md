ClauseFrame: A Protocol for FAR 31.2 Compliance:  Most compliance tooling today is either interpretive or probabilistic - neither is enforceable/ trusted at audit time.  ClauseFrame changes that.  It’s the 1st  open-source, schema-driven logic engine for federal cost allowability under FAR 31.2 &amp; SF 1408— for audit readiness w/ clause citations.
